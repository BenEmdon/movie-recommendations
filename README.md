## Action

[Baby Driver](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/) - A fantastic pairing between music and action, with highs and lows in action, while maintaining a consistent enjoyment throughout the entire film.

[Equalizer2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3766354/) - Robert McCall serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, but how far will he go when that is someone he loves?

[The Emoji Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4877122/) - This animated instant classic has it all: action, comedy, romance, comedy. The plot is simple but really makes you think. Fun for the whole family!

[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zealand adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) -There have been pretty cool comic-book villains on the big screen, but Thanos is really somebody who can take on multiple superheroes and come out unscathed. As yet, he has only been a presence behind the screen in MCU, pulling the strings, and it is in Infinity War that we will see what he is truly capable of.

[City of Ember](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - For generations, the people of the City of Ember have flourished in an amazing world of glittering lights. But Ember's once powerful generator is failing... and the great lamps that illuminate the city are starting to flicker.

[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zealand adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

[The Dark Knight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/) - This is the pinnacle of DC, no, Super Hero Movies. The cast does an amazing job of portraying the characters and the story is just amazing.

## Family
[The LEGO Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/) - This one is fun, clever, and extremely charming. And all animated in LEGO!

## Classics

## Drama
[Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) - Hackers are blamed for making a virus that will capsize five oil tankers.

[The Shawshank Redemption](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - Andy is convicted for the murder of his wife and the golf pro based on muddy footprints leading up to the house, the inability to match a gun to bullets, and testimonies from the neighbors. In real life, a second set of footprints leading up to the house (the killer's), presumably in the mud, and the fact that the neighbors undoubtedly would've heard a gunshot several minutes after Andy's encounter with the couple (whereas if Andy had done it, the gunshot probably would've been right after the shouting), might have been enough to prevent his conviction (or at least delay it until the second suspect was identified). 

[T2 Trainspotting](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2763304/) - After 20 years abroad, Mark Renton returns to Scotland and reunites with his old friends Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie.

[Incendie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) - Overly slow and melodramatic, this movie is kinda sad. Kinda.

A great movie for daydreamers and anybody that wants to travel.

## Thriller
[Argo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/) - This political thriller from 2012 about an undercover CIA agent rescuing six americans trapped in Iran during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis will keep you on the edge of your seat, with an occasional laugh thrown in. All based on a true story.

## Horror
[Event Horizon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119081/) - A rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned...with someone or something new on-board. Classic Horror SciFi. The gold standard for the genre.
