## Adventure
[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) -There have been pretty cool comic-book villains on the big screen, but Thanos is really somebody who can take on multiple superheroes and come out unscathed. As yet, he has only been a presence behind the screen in MCU, pulling the strings, and it is in Infinity War that we will see what he is truly capable of.

[Hunt for the Wilderpeople](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/?ref_=nv_sr_2) - This delightful New Zeland adventure will make you laugh, cry, and laugh some more. It's quirky, dark, and pretty wholesome. A must watch for anyone seeking an action adventure comedy.

## Drama
[V For Vandetta](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409) - In a future British tyranny, a shadowy freedom fighter, known only by the alias of "V", plots to overthrow it with the help of a young woman.

[T2 Trainspotting](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2763304/) - After 20 years abroad, Mark Renton returns to Scotland and reunites with his old friends Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie.
