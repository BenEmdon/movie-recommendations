## Adventure
[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) -There have been pretty cool comic-book villains on the big screen, but Thanos is really somebody who can take on multiple superheroes and come out unscathed.

## Drama
[Incendie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) - Overly slow and melodramatic, this movie is kinda sad. Kinda.

## Family

[The LEGO Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/) - This one is fun, clever, and extremely charming. And all animated in LEGO!

## Adventure
[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/) -There have been pretty cool comic-book villains on the big screen, but Thanos is really somebody who can take on multiple superheroes and come out unscathed. As yet, he has only been a presence behind the screen in MCU, pulling the strings, and it is in Infinity War that we will see what he is truly capable of.

## Classics
[City of Ember](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - For generations, the people of the City of Ember have flourished in an amazing world of glittering lights. But Ember's once powerful generator is failing... and the great lamps that illuminate the city are starting to flicker.

## SuperHero
[The Dark Knight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/) - This is the pinnacle of DC, no, Super Hero Movies. The cast does an amazing job of portraying the characters and the story is just amazing.

## Drama
[Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) - Hackers are blamed for making a virus that will capsize five oil tankers.

[The Shawshank Redemption](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - Andy is convicted for the murder of his wife and the golf pro based on muddy footprints leading up to the house, the inability to match a gun to bullets, and testimonies from the neighbors. In real life, a second set of footprints leading up to the house (the killer's), presumably in the mud, and the fact that the neighbors undoubtedly would've heard a gunshot several minutes after Andy's encounter with the couple (whereas if Andy had done it, the gunshot probably would've been right after the shouting), might have been enough to prevent his conviction (or at least delay it until the second suspect was identified). 

## Thriller
[Argo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/) - This political thriller from 2012 about an undercover CIA agent rescuing six americans trapped in Iran during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis will keep you on the edge of your seat, with an occasional laugh thrown in. All based on a true story.
